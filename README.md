# stata-testmechs

Stata package (MVP) translating key functionality from Jon Roth's TestMechs R package.

## Status
- MVP in progress: default-path implementation only (reduced feature set vs R).

## Reference
The original R source is stored in `r_reference/` for translation and validation.

## Testing
Run do-files in `tests/` after adding this repo to Stata adopath or running from repo root.
